# waterfall-engine

This is a project aimed at calculating LP and GP allocations for a given project assuming a set of commitments and distributions. You can get started by working through the notebook called 'example.ipynb'.

### example.ipynb

To get started with the example notebook, upload your custom transactions.csv to the root project directory, possibly the 'waterfall-engine' folder.

Then in your terminal (at the root project path), install your requirements.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, run all cells in the examples notebook and see the results.
